# Hello World

## Story

No question that your first programming exercise must be a [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) implementation.

## What are you going to learn?

You'll have to use:

 - functions,
 - parameters,
 - call your function with arguments,
 - and also be able to run your script from command line with arguments!

## Tasks

1. Implement the `hello_world()` function which returns `Hello, World!`
    - [MANDATORY] The returned string of the function is exactly `Hello, World!`
    - Function `hello_world()` itself does not print anything

2. Create and implement the parametrized function `hello(name)` that takes one string argument and returns `Hello, <name>!`
    - For any non-empty String return `Hello, <name>!`
    - If `name` is empty or None, return `Hello, World!`
    - Function `hello(name)` itself does not print anything

3. Create and implement the `print_hello(name)` function which prints the result of `hello(name)`!
    - Calling `print_hello(name)` prints `Hello, <name>!`
    - Function `print_hello()` calls `hello()` and uses its return value

4. Implement the main (outside any functions) part of `hello.py` so that it prints the result of `hello(name)` when called from the command line by `python3 hello.py <name>`
    - Calling from the command line with one argument prints `Hello, <name>!` to the console
    - The command line call uses `hello(name)`'s return value

5. [OPTIONAL] Implement the main (outside any functions) part of `hello.py` so that it prints the result of `hello(name)` when called from the command line with multiple arguments by `python3 hello.py <name1> <name2> <name3>`. The required result is `Hello, <name1> <name2> <name3>!`
    - Calling from the command line with multiple argument prints `Hello, <name1> <name2> <name3>!` to the console
    - The command line call uses `hello(name)`'s return value
    - It works for any number of arguments

## General requirements

- Have an installed a Python 3 environment, and an editor to write code!

## Hints

- To complete the `Print command line` task, you have to use command line arguments.<br/>You can check the command line arguments in details from the background materials section.
